# Sorting Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.
Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require data to be in sorted lists.

### Examples of Sorting Algorithms
* Selection sort
* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Heap sort
